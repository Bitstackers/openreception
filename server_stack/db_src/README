Try to keep the RDBMS specific details to a minimum.

SQLite uses (0, 1) instead of (FALSE, TRUE).

We use tables instead of enumeration types to have a more similar schema for
SQLite and more complete RDBMS implementations (i.e. PostgreSQL).

Use:

   make sources # to generate RDBMS specific SQL sources
   make         # to generate "test.db" for SQLite
